# PublishMyData Community Edition

## Overview

PublishMyData is a [Rails Engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) that adds Linked Data functionality to your Rails app including:

* URI dereferencing 
* displaying resources outside your site domain
* dataset pages to describe graphs of data with additional metadata
* A SPARQL Endpoint
* APIs for returning information about individual or fitlerable lists of resources
* default HTML views for datasets, resources, ontologies, concept schemes, etc.
* an extensible view and style framework using Engines, HAML, and Sass

This is the same core code that powers the enterprise, hosted version of PublishMyData. For more details see the [PublishMyData](http://publishmydata.com) website.

## Notes

- PublishMyData uses the [Tripod](http://github.com/Swirrl/tripod) ORM for database access.
- PublishMyData doesn't supply a database - you need to install and run a triple store yourself. We recommend [Fuseki](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/index.html).
- better docs coming soon!

## Getting started

Also: see our [sample app](http://github.com/swirrl/sample_pmd) where we've already done all the below! (We'll make a _generator_ for these tasks soon).


1. Generate a new rails app (without active record or test-unit)

        rails new hello_world -O -T

2. Add publish_my_data to your Gemfile. The minimal contents of the gemfile are as follows
        
        source 'https://rubygems.org'
        gem 'rails', '3.2.15'
        gem 'publish_my_data'


3. Configure PublishMyData (in `application.rb`, or `development|production|test.rb`)

        config.assets.precompile += %w(modernizr.js publish_my_data.js) # <-- required for production

        PublishMyData.configure do |config|
          config.sparql_endpoint = 'http://localhost:3030/pmd/sparql'
          config.local_domain = 'pmd.dev' # the domain under which your linked data resources URIs are minted
          config.sparql_timeout_seconds = 30
          config.tripod_cache_store = nil # Tripod::CacheStores::MemcachedCacheStore.new('localhost:11211')
          config.application_name = "Your Application Name"
        end

4. Mount it in your `routes.rb`
      
        # Note that there is no default home page route for publish_my_data. You need to define your own. e.g.        
 
        get '/', to: redirect('/data'), as: :home # use the data catalogue

        # # or:
        # match '/' => 'home#home', as: 'home'
        

        mount PublishMyData::Engine, at: "/" 


5. Delete all files from the `public` dir except the `robots.txt`.

6. Create an application layout under `layouts/publish_my_data` (i.e. called `application.html.haml` or `application.html.erb` etc). 
   It should provide content for `:head` and `:global_header`, then render `pmd_layout`. e.g.

        - content_for :head do
          %title
            My page title

        - content_for :global_header do
          My header here

        = render template: 'layouts/publish_my_data/pmd_layout'

7. Add the helpers in your app's `ApplicationController`, and derive from the engines application controller

        class ApplicationController < PublishMyData::ApplicationController
          helper PublishMyData::Engine.helpers
          helper :all
        end

8. In `assets/stylesheets/application.scss`:

        $pmdconfig_colour_link: #da0;
        /* [...optional style configuration...] */
        @import "publish_my_data.scss";
